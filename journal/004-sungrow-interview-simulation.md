I keep up-to-date with the latest trends in these stacks and frameworks by reading blogs and contributing to open-source projects. I'm always eager to learn new technologies that add value to the project.

### Biggest Challenge

> What do you think would be the biggest challenge in this role?

I think the biggest challenge would be building user trust through the interface. When people book car repairs online, they're dealing with expensive services and may not know the workshop. The frontend has to instantly convey trustworthiness through clear pricing and seamless booking flows.

Technically, integrating with multiple workshop systems while maintaining consistent user experience would be challenging - each workshop has different data formats and processes.

### UX considerations

> What UX considerations are important for a web application?

I think some key UX considerations for a web application include making sure users get the information they need right away. I'd start with progressive disclosure—showing the essentials first, like location and availability, and then letting users dive into more details if they want. Mobile-first design is critical since many users operate on mobile.

Provide clear next steps and contact information to reduce anxiety about what happens next.

> How would you approach building trust in an online car repair booking interface?

Trust is crucial for car repair bookings since people are dealing with expensive services from unfamiliar providers.

I'd focus on transparency - clear upfront pricing, detailed service descriptions, no hidden fees. Social proof through real reviews, workshop certifications, and clear business information. A reliable booking process with confirmations, updates, and easy support contact.

The interface needs to look professional and provide easy cancellation options. If users know they can easily change bookings and reach real people for help, they're more likely to trust the initial booking.

### Workflow

> Describe your daily development workflow

I start with daily standup, then tackle the most complex tasks when I'm fresh. I work in focused blocks with breaks, review teammates' code throughout the day, and help junior developers with questions. Before pushing code, I test locally and run linters. End of day, I update task status so I can resume smoothly the next morning.

### Questions

> Do you have any questions for us?  

- What does a typical day look like for this role?
- Could you tell me about the team structure and how collaboration usually works?
- What opportunities are there for professional growth in this role?
- When I might hear back about the interview?

## Work Experience

### Abroad Experience

> Have you worked abroad before?  

This would be my first international work experience with a German company.

I'm eager to contribute my technical skills in a multicultural environment. I adapt quickly to new environments. I feel confident working with global teams and growing in this role.

### Previous Experience

> Can you tell us about your previous work experience?  

Of course. As a Full-Stack Developer with over 8 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable and high-performance web applications.

In my most recent role at Toyou Feiji, a tech company specializing in storage solutions, I led the architecture redesign of our centralized storage management platform using Vue.js and TypeScript, which improved system scalability and maintainability. Additionally, I migrated our distributed storage platform from Webpack to Vite, achieving over 60% faster build times. I also actively mentored three junior developers in modern frontend practices.

Before that, I joined Blitz Interactive Entertainment, a mobile game development and gaming media company, I took on more responsibility. A key project was building an instant messaging system. This was where I gained backend experience with Spring Boot.

My career began at Jinji Network Technology, an online baking tutorial company, where I built a solid foundation in web development using React and also gained my first experience in cross-platform mobile development with React Native.

Now, I've moved to Germany to seek a new challenge in a more advanced tech environment. I'm looking for a senior frontend role where I can apply my skills and experience. I'm very excited about the possibility of contributing to your team.

### Toyou Feiji

> What were your key contributions at Toyou Feiji?  

Sure. For the past two years at Toyou Feiji, it's a tech company specializing in storage solutions, I worked as a Senior Frontend Developer with full-stack responsibilities. I focused on improving the performance, architecture, and overall developer experience for our storage management platforms. My key contributions fall into three main areas.

First, my primary project was leading the architecture redesign of our centralized storage platform. The old system had no clear separation between frontend and backend, making it difficult to maintain. So, I led the design of a completely new frontend architecture using Vue.js and TypeScript. This created a much more scalable, component-based system. As a result, our codebase became type-safe and easier to work with, which really boosted the team's development speed.

Next, on our distributed storage platform, I focused on optimizing the developer workflow. The project had extremely slow build times, so I migrated from Webpack to Vite, and integrated ESLint. As a result, we achieved over 60% faster build times, and the ESLint integration helped us fix over 300 legacy issues, significantly improving our code quality.

And third, our support team was overwhelmed with repetitive questions, so I built an AI-powered chat tool using Vue.js with Ragflow. This tool automated responses to common questions and helped our support team focus on more complex cases.

Finally, I mentored three junior developers and established a standard code review process that significantly improved our team's code quality.

> Can you tell me more about Toyou Feiji Electronics?

Toyou Feiji Electronics is a tech company specializing in storage solutions. We primarily serve enterprise clients and government organizations, providing storage infrastructure including both hardware and software. Our services include data storage and management. I contributed to developing the storage management platform software.

### Blitz Interactive

> What were your key contributions at Blitz Interactive?

Yes, absolutely. My time at Blitz Interactive was a period of huge growth for me. It's a mobile game development and gaming media company. I joined as a Junior Frontend Developer, but I quickly took on a lot of responsibility.

My primary project there was building the company's instant messaging system from the ground up. This was a critical feature for our company portal to handle real-time business inquiries. Although I worked as a frontend developer, I took ownership of the entire project. This meant I not only built the chat interface in the frontend, but also maintained the backend system and developed new features. I also deployed the whole system using Docker. It was an excellent full-stack learning experience.

Additionally, I also developed the company's official website, which was crucial for our external presence and client engagement.

Moreover, I also worked on improving our internal tools. For example, I built a reusable component library with over 20 components, which helped speed up development for the team.

So, my time at Blitz was really about that transition from being a junior developer to becoming an engineer.

### Jinji

> What were your key contributions at Jinji Network Technology?

Jinji Network was my first role after graduating, it's an online baking tutorial company, my work there was quite diverse, which was great for learning.

My primary project was developing a cross-platform mobile app using React Native. I worked on features for both Android and iOS, for example, building a video player. This gave me hands-on experience with the challenges of mobile development.

On the web side, I focused on building an admin dashboard with React and Ant Design. This was where I built up my skills in React, implementing features like file uploads and data visualizations. I also redesigned the company's official website to improve user experience.

So, my time at Jinji was all about learning and building. It boosted my passion for web development and prepared me for the more complex challenges I took on later in my career.

### Backend Experience

> Could you tell me about your backend experience?

My main expertise is in frontend development, but I also have hands-on backend experience, especially with Spring Boot.

At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I maintained the backend and developed new features for the company's instant messaging system using Spring Boot. This involved creating RESTful APIs and deploying it with Docker.

Most recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I worked with the backend team to refactor APIs. I used Python and Django to build Redfish-compliant APIs for our centralized storage management platform, and successfully refactored over 100 interfaces.

> Tell me about developing those Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs

The Redfish APIs were part of our storage management platform redesign. Redfish is a standard REST API specification for managing data center hardware - it's widely used in enterprise storage systems.

I refactored over 100 APIs to follow the Redfish standard. This involved standardizing URL patterns, data models, and error handling to match Redfish specifications. The main challenge was mapping our existing storage data to standardized schemas while maintaining backward compatibility.

> How does backend experience help you as a frontend developer?

Backend experience helps me understand APIs deeply, communicate better with backend teams, and debug issues faster. I can design better error handling. This full-stack perspective helps me build interfaces that work smoothly with backend systems.

### Vite Migration / Challenge

> Can you share a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our distributed storage management platform had a critical performance issue. Our project was based on Vue 2, as the codebase grew, the Webpack build process was taking over 10 minutes, which was severely impacting our team's productivity.

My task was to find a solution that would improve build performance without disrupting our existing codebase or introducing bugs.

I researched various approaches and determined migrating from Webpack to Vite. However, this was complex because this project was based on Vue 2, and Vite primarily supports Vue 3. I had to carefully plan the migration, configure compatibility plugins, update our build configuration, and coordinate with our testing team to ensure stability.

As a result, we reduced build times from 10 minutes to under 4 minutes, over 60% faster then before. More importantly, this taught me the value of planning when upgrading core infrastructure and the importance of close collaboration with testing team.

> You mentioned improving build times by 60% - how did you achieve that?

I migrated our build tools from Webpack to Vite. Webpack was slow because it bundled everything, even during development. Vite uses native ES modules and only processes changed files. This significantly reduced build times and improved team productivity.

### Architecture Redesign

> Could you walk me through the key decisions you made during that process?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our centralized storage management platform had no clear separation between frontend and backend, making it difficult to scale and maintain.

As a senior frontend developer, my task was to lead the redesign and implementation of a new, completely decoupled frontend architecture.

My first key decision was selecting Vue.js with TypeScript. I chose Vue.js and TypeScript for performance and type-safety, implementing a modular, component-based structure to enhance maintainability.

I established a standard code review process that ensured code quality.

As a result, I created a scalable, type-safe system that improved team productivity, enabling independent frontend and backend development for faster iterations.

 > What were the main challenges, and how did you ensure the new architecture was scalable and maintainable?

The main challenge was we couldn't risk a complete system replacement all at once.

My solution was a phased migration using a Nginx proxy. We used a proxy to direct traffic for specific routes to the new Vue application, while legacy pages were still served by the old system. This minimized risk and allowed us to iterate based on user feedback.

### Vue vs React

> How would you decide which framework, Vue or React, to use? What are the key technical trade-offs you would consider?

The choice between React and Vue.js really depends on several factors. From a technical standpoint, React offers more flexibility and has a larger ecosystem, but Vue provides a gentler learning curve and clearer structure out of the box.

React's component architecture offers more control, but Vue's template syntax can speed up development. React has better TypeScript support, while Vue offers simpler state management.

Overall, if the existing codebase or team expertise heavily favors React, that would be the practical choice.

> What are the key differences between Vue and React?

Both Vue and React are popular frontend frameworks, but they have different design concepts.

Vue provides a more opinionated structure with templates and built-in features like reactivity and directives, which makes it easier to start quickly. React is more flexible and component-driven, relying on JSX and external libraries for things like state management or routing.

In short, Vue feels more integrated, while React gives more freedom and ecosystem choices.

> This role focuses on React, but your recent experience is with Vue.js - how quickly can you transition?

I actually use React regularly in personal projects, my blog is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, which matches your tech stack exactly. The concepts between Vue and React are very similar. Having experience with both frameworks actually gives me a broader perspective on frontend development.

> What's cons and pros of React as a framework?

React has several strengths. It's component-based, which makes code reusable and maintainable. Its large ecosystem and community provide many third-party libraries and solutions. It also supports server-side rendering with frameworks like Next.js, which improves performance and SEO.

On the downside, React is not a full framework—it's just a view library. So you often need to make choices about routing, state management, or styling, which can increase complexity. Also, JSX and the fast-moving ecosystem can have a steep learning curve for newcomers.

### Communication

> How did you handle communication challenges?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, when I redesigned our centralized storage platform. As a senior frontend developer, I also worked with backend teams to refactor Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs.

We need to ensure the new APIs does not affect the original functionality and is type-safe. The main communication challenge was confirming the type definitions and possible values for each new API with the backend team.

We established a communication approach, we scheduled daily technical meetings to track complex issues and ensure clear communication.

We set up a shared documentation and a Postman collection so we could test endpoints together in real-time.

As a result, we successfully refactored all APIs, I also refactored over 100 interfaces.

This experience taught me that clear documentation is a great tool for communication.

> Tell me about a time you had to make a technical decision that the team disagreed with.

I focus on clear reasoning rather than opinions. I listen to the team's concerns, create small code demo when possible.

When I proposed our storage platform migrating from Webpack to Vite, team members worried about disrupting our build process. In order to resolve the conflict, I created a detailed migration plan and organized a technical meeting where I presented a minimal demo showing the performance benefits. The concrete demonstration convinced the team.  

 This experience taught me that making strong technical decisions requires both solid reasoning and clear demonstration of value.

### Job Scope / Documentation

> Can you describe a time when you had to take initiative on a project or problem that wasn't clearly defined in your job scope?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, I redesigned our centralized storage platform and collaborated with the backend team to standardize new APIs.

A key challenge was that no one had a clearly understanding about Redfish compliance. So I researched the Redfish standards, created documentation to guide the team, mapped old APIs to requirements. This wasn't in my job scope, but I saw it as essential for project success.

As a result, the APIs refactoring was successful, I also refactored over 100 interfaces. It was a excellent full-stack learning experience.

So, I'm comfortable taking on tasks beyond my job scope. And I think dive into different job scope can be beneficial for personal growth as you can learn new skills and knowledge.

> How do you document your code and technical decisions?

I write clear comments for complex logic, and add JSDoc for public APIs. For technical decisions, I document the 'why' behind choices - like why we migrated to Vite. At my last job, we used Confluence for this. My principle is: could another developer maintain this code if I left tomorrow?

### Learning Knowledge

> How do you stay current with rapidly evolving web technologies?

I keep up with web technologies by various approaches: I follow tech blogs like JavaScript Weekly and some personal blogs. Additionally, I actively contribute to open-source projects which keeps me hands-on with new technologies, and my GitHub projects force me to stay updated with community trends.

For domain-specific knowledge, I'd start with the company's documentation and industry standards, then actively learn from colleagues and hands-on project work.

### Data Visualization

> Can you walk me through a specific project where you implemented a data visualization dashboard?

I've developed data visualization dashboards in two key projects, both using ECharts.js.

At Blitz Interactive, I built an admin dashboard for our instant messaging system that handled real-time business inquiries. I used ECharts.js to display live users, inquiry types, and customer satisfaction scores.

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, I created a more complex storage device monitoring dashboard. We needed to track hardware and software metrics across multiple storage clusters, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network. I used ECharts.js line charts to display real-time status indicators.

A major challenge was managing hundreds of metrics for data disks that updated every few seconds. I solved this by implementing data aggregation on the frontend, showing detailed metrics for selected devices while displaying summarized views for the cluster overview.

Both projects taught me the importance of balancing information density in data visualization.

### CI/CD

> Can you describe a project where you implemented or contributed to a CI/CD pipeline for a front-end application? Please

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, on our storage management platform, we used Git for version control, with feature branches undergoing ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks via pre-commit hooks. I configured Jenkins to automate builds for our frontend, creating binary files.

Since our storage devices were in a secure, offline environment, which limited full CI/CD automation. deployment had to be performed manually by the hardware team.

### XSS/CSRF

> Can you share an experience where you addressed a cross-browser compatibility issue or a front-end security vulnerability (e.g., XSS, CSRF)?

At Blitz Interactive, I secured our instant messaging system against XSS attacks, as user inputs like chat messages posed risks of malicious scripts.

During code reviews, I identified unescaped inputs in the frontend. I used the third library to filter inputs, preserving safe HTML for rich media, and ensuring secure user interactions.

 I tested compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. This strengthened my skills in frontend security.

### Mentore Junior

> Describe your management style when mentoring junior developers?

At Toyou Feiji, I mentored three junior developers using a structured approach. First, I got to know each person's learning style and career goals, then created personalized development plans.

I assigned a different range of development tasks, starting with simple ones and gradually increasing complexity until they were able to undertake all development tasks.

The key challenge was building their confidence while maintaining code quality, so I established a standardized code review process to ensure code quality.

> How do you balance writing code yourself versus mentoring junior developers?

At Toyou Feiji, I split my time 80% coding and 20% mentoring three juniors. In daily development, I coded key UI components and guided juniors via code reviews.

During the mentoring period, we have regular meetings to summarize and provide feedback to ensure that we learn something new each time.

### Deadlines / High-Pressure

> How would you handle tight deadlines with limited resources?

I actually handle pressure quite well. When facing tight deadlines or high-pressure situations, I remain calm and focused by prioritizing tasks. I focus on three things: what's most important, using what we have, and clear communication.

First, I work with the team to decide what features we must deliver and what can wait. I will built the basic functions first, then added extra features later.

Second, I tell people about problems early, not at the last minute. If we need to change the plan, I explain the options clearly.

I'm happy to work extra hours when needed, but I try to keep code quality good so we don't create bigger problems later.

### AI

> How do you use AI tools in your development workflow?

I actively use AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini in my development workflow. They're excellent for research, documentation lookup, and helping with simple coding tasks, this significantly improves my development speed.

However, I see AI as a powerful assistant, not a replacement. Complex architecture decisions and full project development still require developer expertise.

At Toyou Feiji, I also worked on integrating AI into our workflow. We built an AI chat tool using RAGflow that helped our support team handle customer service issues. This tool automated responses to common questions and helped our support team focus on more complex cases.

> Can you tell me more about your role in AI chat tool?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our support team was overwhelmed with repetitive questions, so I led the development of an AI-powered chat tool.

My role involved designing and building the tool using Vue.js for the frontend and integrating it with Ragflow to power AI-driven responses. I focused on creating an intuitive interface with clear navigation and responsive design, optimized for both desktop and mobile users. This tool automated responses to common questions and helped our support team focus on more complex cases.

### Accomplishment / Interesting

> What's your biggest professional accomplishment?

My biggest accomplishment was leading the complete redesign of our storage management platform. As a result, I created a scalable, type-safe system that improved team productivity, enabling independent frontend and backend development for faster iterations.

> What's the most interesting project you've worked on?

The most interesting project was developing an AI chat tool integrated with Ragflow for customer support. It was my first deep dive into how AI can enhance user experience. The technical challenge of making AI responses feel natural and helpful was really engaging.

### Code Review

> How do you approach code reviews?

I see code reviews as both quality control and learning opportunities. As a reviewer, I focus on functionality, code standards, and sharing knowledge. When my code is reviewed, I'm open to feedback and try to make it easy to review with clear comments.

At my last job, I set up a code review process where we required at least one approval and ensure code quality, especially for junior developers.

> How do you ensure code quality in your projects?

I use multiple approaches: ESLint and Prettier for consistent code style, mandatory code reviews before merging, TypeScript for type safety, and tests for critical functionality. At my last job, implementing these practices resolved over 300 code issues. The key is automating quality checks so they're built into the workflow, not optional.

### 未来规划

> 你的未来规划是什么？  
> What are your future plans?

我的长期规划是扎根在慕尼黑，找到合适的公司，从事前端开发相关的工作并稳定发展，持续打磨技术实力。

在技术方向上，我会并保持对行业的热情，持续深耕前端领域，保持对新技术的探索与学习，重点关注前端性能优化、前端工程化以及与 AI 结合的前端应用场景。我的职业目标是成长为一名具有全局视野的高级 WEB 专家，最终能够胜任 WEB 架构师的角色。

五年后，我希望自己不仅能在技术上独当一面，还能在团队中发挥引领作用，参与架构设计、推动前端最佳实践的落地，并指导年轻的开发者共同进步。

My long-term plan is to settle down in Munich and build a stable career in front-end development. I want to keep sharpening my technical skills and stay passionate about what I do.

Technically, I plan to keep diving deeper into the front-end field—constantly exploring new technologies and trends. I'm especially interested in performance optimization, front-end engineering, and how AI can be integrated into modern web applications. My career goal is to grow into a senior front-end expert with a broad architectural vision, and eventually take on a front-end architect role.

In five years, I hope to be someone who not only delivers strong technical results but also plays a leadership role—contributing to architectural design, promoting best practices, and mentoring younger developers to help them grow.

### 优势和劣势

> 你的优势和劣势是什么？  
> What are your strengths and weaknesses?

我认为我的最大优势是扎实的前端基础和较强的系统化思维能力。我有八年的前端开发经验，对 Vue 和 React 等框架有深入理解，能够快速构建高质量、可维护的前端架构。同时，我非常重视性能优化和代码质量，积极在团队中推动最佳实践，例如使用 TypeScript、ESLint 和代码审查来保持代码的高质量。

其次，我具备全栈视角来解决问题。虽然我的主要方向是前端开发，但我也有后端开发经验，这让我能够理解接口设计和后端逻辑，从而更高效地与后端协作并优化系统整体性能。

我对前端新技术充满热情，有较强的学习和适应能力，工作之余也会学习和实践新的技术栈。比如，虽然我工作中主要使用 Vue，但我也会在个人项目中积极尝试 React，从不同的框架视角来提升前端工程化的理解，提升知识面的广度。此外，我还积极参与开源项目，并长期维护自己的技术博客，分享开发经验和学习心得。我认为持续学习和知识分享是个人成长的重要部分。

至于劣势，我有时在追求技术细节上会投入过多时间。实现业务需求时，我总是追求最佳实践，无论是性能优化还是代码结构有时会投入较多时间打磨细节。但随着经验积累，我学会了更好地平衡优先级，在 " 完美实现 " 和 " 高效交付 " 之间找到合理的平衡。

I'd say my biggest strength is my solid front-end foundation and strong systematic thinking. I have around eight years of experience in front-end development, with a deep understanding of frameworks like Vue and React. I can quickly build high-quality, maintainable architectures, and I always pay close attention to performance and code quality. I also like to promote best practices within the team — for example, using TypeScript, ESLint, and regular code reviews to keep our codebase clean and consistent.

Another strength of mine is that I approach problems with a full-stack mindset. Even though my main focus is front-end development, I've also worked on backend tasks. This experience helps me better understand API design and backend logic, making collaboration smoother and improving overall system performance.

I'm also passionate about learning new technologies. Outside of work, I often explore different tech stacks — for instance, most of my professional projects use Vue, but I also build personal projects with React to gain a broader perspective. In addition, I'm active in open-source projects and maintain my own technical blog where I share what I learn. I believe continuous learning and sharing knowledge are key to long-term growth.

As for my weakness, I sometimes spend too much time perfecting technical details. When implementing business requirements, I tend to go deep into performance optimization or code structure. Over time, I've learned to prioritize better and strike the right balance between "perfect implementation" and "efficient delivery.

### 业务上手

> 入职后如何业务上手？  
> How would you get up to speed with the business after joining the company?

入职后，我会分三个阶段快速熟悉业务。

首先，我会主动学习业务背景，阅读产品文档、技术资料和代码库，快速了解系统架构和核心业务流程。

其次，我会积极与团队沟通，向产品经理和前后端同事了解业务细节。如果遇到不熟悉的领域，我会主动请教经验丰富的同事，确保理解准确。

最后，我会通过实践加深理解，通常从小型任务或功能模块开始，边做边学，在保证代码质量的同时不断完善对业务逻辑的掌握。同时，我会用工具（比如 Obsidian）记录关键知识点，整理成个人笔记，方便后续复盘和优化。

通过这种方式，我通常能在较短时间内熟悉业务，独立承担任务，并为团队带来高效协作和高质量的代码输出。

When I join a new company, I usually go through three steps to get up to speed quickly.

First, I take the initiative to learn the business background — I read product documentation, technical specs, and the codebase to understand the overall system architecture and core business logic.

Second, I actively communicate with the team. I talk to product managers and both frontend and backend teammates to understand the details of the business. If I come across something unfamiliar, I'm not afraid to ask experienced colleagues for guidance — it saves time and helps me build the right understanding from the start.

Finally, I learn by doing. I usually start with smaller development tasks to apply what I've learned and verify my understanding in practice. During this process, I make sure to write clean, reliable code while building up my knowledge base — for example, I use tools like Obsidian to document key points and lessons learned for future reference.

By following these steps, I'm usually able to get comfortable with the business in a short time — not only working independently but also contributing to efficient teamwork and high-quality code delivery.

### 工作压力

> 你如何应对工作中的压力？  
> How do you handle pressure at work?

我认为工作中的压力是常态，同时也是促使个人成长和进步的动力。

面对压力时，我通常会从两方面来应对。第一，做好自我管理。通过拆分任务，列出优先级清单，使用 " 四象限法 " 区分紧急/重要工作，安排工作节奏并高效推进；其次，积极沟通与协作。如果遇到不熟悉的业务场景，主动向经验丰富的同事请教；如果任务量超出预期，提前和领导沟通调整节奏。这样既能高效解决问题，也能防止压力的积累。

I think pressure is a normal part of work, and in many cases, it actually drives personal growth and improvement.

When I'm under pressure, I usually deal with it in two ways. First, I focus on self-management. I break big tasks into smaller steps, make a clear list of priorities, and use the "urgent–important" principle to plan my schedule and keep things moving efficiently. Second, I believe in open communication and teamwork. If I'm facing something unfamiliar, I'll ask experienced colleagues for advice. And if the workload becomes too heavy, I'll talk with my manager early on to adjust the pace or priorities.

This way, I can handle challenges more effectively and keep stress from building up.

### 最大挑战

> 之前在工作中遇到的最大的挑战是什么？  
> What was the biggest challenge you faced in your previous work?

在上一家公司同有飞骥，我们的分布式存储管理平台面临一个棘手的性能挑战。项目基于 Vue 2 和 Webpack，随着功能模块的持续增加，代码库规模扩大，开发模式的冷启动时间长达 10 分钟，严重拖慢团队效率。同时，考虑到 Vue 2 即将停止维护以及未来计划使用 Vue 3 重构的长期规划，优化构建工具成为迫切需求。

我主导了优化工作，提出迁移到 Vite 的方案，提升构建速度的同时并为未来 Vue 3 升级做准备。但挑战在于，Vite 主要支持 Vue 3，迁移 Vue 2 项目涉及复杂的兼容性问题，且项目在内网开发，无法联通外网，增加了实施难度。我调研 `@vitejs/plugin-vue2` 等插件，制定了详细迁移计划，包括重写构建配置、优化兼容问题，确保零副作用迁移。为应对内网限制，我在外网搭建了最小化 Demo 验证方案可行性，并手动同步依赖包到内网环境，在升级成功后，还要与测试团队密切协作，确保迁移稳定性。

最终，我们将冷启动时间从 10 分钟缩短到 3 分钟，性能提升 70% 以上，加快了开发迭代，还提升了团队调试体验，为后续 Vue 3 迁移奠定了基础。

In my previous company, Toyou Feiji Electronics, we had a major performance challenge with our distributed storage management platform. The project was built with Vue 2 and Webpack, and as the codebase grew larger over time, the cold start during development took almost ten minutes — which really slowed down the whole team. On top of that, since Vue 2 was reaching end-of-life and we were planning to migrate to Vue 3 in the future, it became urgent to improve our build toolchain.

I took the lead on this optimization effort and proposed migrating the project to Vite. The goal was not only to improve build performance but also to prepare the foundation for a smooth upgrade to Vue 3 later on. However, the biggest challenge was that Vite primarily supports Vue 3, so making it work with Vue 2 required solving a lot of compatibility issues. Plus, our project was developed in an internal network without external internet access, which made things even more complicated.

To handle this, I researched solutions like `@vitejs/plugin-vue2` and came up with a detailed migration plan — rewriting the build configuration, resolving compatibility problems, and ensuring a zero-side-effect transition. Because of the internal network, I built a minimal demo environment externally to test the approach, then manually synchronized all dependencies into the internal environment. After the upgrade, I worked closely with the QA team to ensure the system's stability.

In the end, we successfully reduced the cold start time from ten minutes to about three minutes — a performance improvement of over 70%. It significantly accelerated our development iterations and improved the team's debugging experience, while laying the groundwork for the future Vue 3 migration.

### 困难解决

> 工作遇到困难怎么解决？

遇到工作困难时，我的处理方式是：先冷静分析问题本质，然后系统化地解决它。

1. **先明确问题**：搞清楚具体卡在哪里，是技术问题、需求理解偏差还是资源或时间不足
2. **自主尝试解决**：查文档、搜索类似案例、Debug 调试、借助 AI 工具
3. **适时求助**：如果自己研究很长时间还没进展，会主动向同事或技术社区请教
4. **复盘总结**：问题解决后整理成文档，避免重复踩坑。可以做内部分享。

具体案例：

- 在同有飞骥公司，前后端分离重构后端 Redfish API 时，我们团队并没有人知道它的具体标准与规范。我负责进行前期调研，我查阅了大量文档，包括 Redfish API 的白皮书、华为云 iBMC Redfish 接口参考文档、 H3C HDM Redfish 参考手册等大量资料。最终梳理出了第一版示例接口，为后续的整体重构提供了模板和方向。
- 在暴击互动娱乐，IM 客服系统开始负责部署是后端同事，但是当他离职后，因为我是最熟悉这个系统的开发人员。我当时就对全栈开发有很浓厚的兴趣，就主动承担了维护与更新的担子。虽然我当时没有任何 Java 和 Spring Boot 经验，我通过研究代码 " 干中学 "，学会了 Docker 镜像制作和服务器部署。这次经历让我对后端开发有了实质性的了解，也为后续的全栈工作打下了基础。

### 加班文化

> 你对加班的看法是什么？  
> What's your view on working overtime?

我认为适度加班是程序员工作的常态。我觉得关键不在于加班本身，而是工作效率。我通常会安排高效的工作节奏，尽量在正常工作时间内把事情做好，提高效率、减少无效加班。当然，如果遇到项目上线节点、紧急修复问题或者一些关键节点，我也愿意配合团队加班完成目标。

在上一家公司我们也经常有加班的情况，比如赶项目发版节点、紧急修复线上问题或者紧急客户定制化需求，我们也会有晚上和周末加班。同时，我们会通过复盘和流程优化提升长期效率。

I think a reasonable amount of overtime is pretty normal in the tech industry. For me, the key isn't about whether you work overtime, but how efficiently you work. I always try to get things done during regular hours by staying focused and managing my time well, so unnecessary overtime can be avoided.

That said, if there's an important deadline, a product release, or an urgent issue that needs to be fixed, I'm absolutely willing to stay late and support the team.

In my previous company, we sometimes had to work overtime too — for example, when preparing for a release, handling urgent production bugs, or meeting special client requests. In those cases, we also made a habit of reviewing the process afterward to find ways to improve efficiency and reduce the need for future overtime.

### 领导上级

> 你期望跟什么样上级一起工作？  
> What kind of manager or supervisor would you like to work with?

我认为不同风格的领导都有各自的优势，而我本身的适应能力比较强。不过如果可以选择，我理想的上级大致具备以下特点：

- 能够为团队争取资源，例如合理的排期、必要的技术投入，让团队可以专注做好工作；
- 沟通清晰、有方向感，能够明确地传达目标、任务背景、优先级和预期结果，让大家执行时更有方向；
- 具备专业判断力，在技术选型、方案评审等关键环节能给出有价值的建议，帮团队少走弯路；
- 信任团队、注重反馈，在明确目标后给予团队足够的自主权，而不是事无巨细地管控。

总的来说，我最希望能与一位能够赋能团队、注重合作和成长的上级共事，因为这样的环境最能激发团队潜力。

I think every manager has their own leadership style, and I'm quite adaptable to different ways of working. But if I could choose, my ideal manager would be someone who:

- **Supports the team** by securing the right resources — things like reasonable timelines and the necessary technical investment — so the team can focus on doing good work.
- **Communicates clearly**, setting well-defined goals and explaining the background, priorities, and expectations behind each task. That kind of clarity really helps the team stay aligned and efficient.
- **Has strong technical judgment**, someone who can provide valuable input during tech reviews or architectural discussions and help the team avoid potential pitfalls.
- **Builds trust and gives feedback**, meaning once the goals are clear, they give the team enough autonomy to execute, rather than micromanaging every detail.

Overall, I value a manager who empowers their team and focuses on collaboration and growth — that kind of environment brings out everyone's best performance.

> 如果遇到不符合你期望的 leader 怎么办？

我会先主动适应和沟通。每个人都有不同的风格，可能只是我还没找到合适的协作方式。如果确实有工作方式上的分歧，我会选择合适的时机、以建设性的方式提出建议。毕竟大家的目标都是把事情做好。

> 你能接受强势的管理风格吗？

可以接受。如果 leader 在专业上有过人之处，强势的决策反而能提高效率。我在乎的是 ' 强势但专业 '，而不是 ' 强势但武断 '。只要决策合理、对团队有利，我都能配合。
