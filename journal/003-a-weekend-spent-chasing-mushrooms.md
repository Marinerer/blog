On Saturday, my girlfriend and I joined a mushroom-picking trip—it was my first real foray into Munich's mushroom season.

There were about a dozen of us, mostly Chinese students studying in Munich, plus a few older ladies. We'd packed everything the night before—paper bags, cloth bags, gloves, a small knife.

Getting there was its own little journey, about an hour later we arrived at our meeting point, Neupullach Gasthaus. After a short wait, our guide showed up—everyone affectionately calls him "Brother Fang." He wasted no time leading us into the woods. It was peak mushroom season, and the forest floor was dotted with all kinds of mushrooms—some delicious, others definitely not for eating. Since many in the group were beginners, Brother Fang gave a mini field lecture on how to tell edible species from the toxic ones.

Even though it was my first official outing, my girlfriend had already taught me a few basics on our hikes, so I could recognize some common edible types. Instead of sticking close to the group, the two of us ventured ahead and started our own "carpet search."

After about an hour and a half, crossing through two patches of forest, our haul was pretty decent—we managed to fill up a big bag. To catch the return bus, my girlfriend and I called it a day and headed home.

Back home we sorted our treasures: mostly *Bay bolete* and *Red-footed bolete*, plus a few *Chanterelle*. We turned them into a mushroom feast that night—two quick stir-fried dishes that tasted incredible. No luck finding the prized porcini or honey mushrooms this time, but with honey mushroom season just around the corner, we're already excited to try again.

In fact, next weekend's foraging trip is already on the calendar. After a week of rain, the mushrooms should be thriving, just waiting for us to pick them. Can't wait.
