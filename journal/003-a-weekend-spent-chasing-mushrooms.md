On Saturday, my girlfriend and I joined a mushroom-picking trip—it was my first time really experiencing Munich's mushroom season.

There were about a dozen of us, mostly Chinese students studying in Munich, plus a few older ladies. We'd packed everything the night before—paper bags, cloth bags, gloves, a small knife.

It took us about an hour to get there, and then we arrived at our meeting point, Neupullach Gasthaus. After a short wait, our guide showed up—everyone affectionately calls him "Brother Fang." Without delay, he took us into the forest. It was peak mushroom season, and the forest floor was dotted with all kinds of mushrooms—some delicious, others definitely not for eating. Since many in the group were beginners, Brother Fang walked us through the basics on how to tell edible species from the toxic ones.

Even though it was my first real trip, my girlfriend had already taught me a few basics on our hikes, so I could recognize some common edible types. Instead of sticking close to the group, we searched the forest on our own.

After about an hour and a half, crossing through two patches of forest, our haul was pretty decent—we managed to fill up a big bag. To catch the return bus, we decided to wrap up and head home.

Back home we went through what we'd picked: mostly *Bay bolete* and *Red-footed bolete*, plus a few *Chanterelle*. We turned them into a mushroom feast that night—two quick stir-fries that turned out really good. No luck finding the porcini or honey mushrooms we were hoping for this time, but with honey mushroom season just around the corner, we're already excited to try again.

In fact, next weekend's trip is already planned. After this week's rain, the forest should be full of mushrooms—can't wait to get back out there.
