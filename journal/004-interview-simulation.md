This would be my first international work experience with a German company.

I'm eager to contribute my technical skills in a multicultural environment. I adapt quickly to new environments. I feel confident working with global teams and growing in this role.

### Previous Experience

> Can you tell us about your previous work experience?  

Of course. As a Full-Stack Developer with over 8 years of experience, I specialize in building scalable and high-performance web applications.

My career began at Jinji Network Technology, an online baking tutorial company, where I built a solid foundation in web development using React and also gained my first experience in cross-platform mobile development with React Native.

From there, I joined Blitz Interactive Entertainment, a mobile game development and gaming media company, I took on more responsibility. A key project was building an instant messaging system. This was where I gained backend experience with Spring Boot.

In my most recent role at Toyou Feiji, a tech company specializing in storage solutions, I led the architecture redesign of our centralized storage management platform using Vue.js and TypeScript, which improved system scalability and maintainability. Additionally, I migrated our distributed storage platform from Webpack to Vite, achieving over 60% faster build times. I also actively mentored three junior developers in modern frontend practices.

Now, I've moved to Germany to seek a new challenge in a more advanced tech environment. I'm looking for a senior frontend role where I can apply my skills and experience. I'm very excited about the possibility of contributing to your team.

### Toyou Feiji

> What were your key contributions at Toyou Feiji?  

Sure. For the past two years at Toyou Feiji, it's a tech company specializing in storage solutions, I worked as a Senior Frontend Developer with full-stack responsibilities. I focused on improving the performance, architecture, and overall developer experience for our storage management platforms. My key contributions fall into three main areas.

First, my primary project was leading the architecture redesign of our centralized storage platform. The old system had no clear separation between frontend and backend, making it difficult to maintain. So, I led the design of a completely new frontend architecture using Vue.js and TypeScript. This created a much more scalable, component-based system. As a result, our codebase became type-safe and easier to work with, which really boosted the team's development speed.

Next, on our distributed storage platform, I focused on optimizing the developer workflow. The project had extremely slow build times, so I migrated from Webpack to Vite, and integrated ESLint. As a result, we achieved over 60% faster build times, and the ESLint integration helped us fix over 300 legacy issues, significantly improving our code quality.

And third, our support team was overwhelmed with repetitive questions, so I built an AI-powered chat tool using Vue.js with Ragflow. This tool automated responses to common questions and helped our support team focus on more complex cases.

Finally, I mentored three junior developers and established a standard code review process that significantly improved our team's code quality.

> Can you tell me more about Toyou Feiji Electronics?

Toyou Feiji Electronics is a tech company specializing in storage solutions. We primarily serve enterprise clients and government organizations, providing storage infrastructure including both hardware and software. Our services include data storage and management.

### Blitz Interactive

> What were your key contributions at Blitz Interactive?

Yes, absolutely. My time at Blitz Interactive was a period of huge growth for me. It's a mobile game development and gaming media company. I joined as a Junior Frontend Developer, but I quickly took on a lot of responsibility.

My primary project there was building the company's instant messaging system from the ground up. This was a critical feature for our company portal to handle real-time business inquiries. Although I worked as a frontend developer, I took ownership of the entire project. This meant I not only built the chat interface in the frontend, but also maintained the backend system and developed new features. I also deployed the whole system using Docker. It was an excellent full-stack learning experience.

Additionally, I also developed the company's official website, which was crucial for our external presence and client engagement.

Moreover, I also worked on improving our internal tools. For example, I built a reusable component library with over 20 components, which helped speed up development for the team.

So, my time at Blitz was really about that transition from being a junior developer to becoming an engineer.

### Jinji

> What were your key contributions at Jinji Network Technology?

Jinji Network was my first role after graduating, it's an online baking tutorial company, my work there was quite diverse, which was great for learning.

My primary project was developing a cross-platform mobile app using React Native. I worked on features for both Android and iOS, for example, building a video player. This gave me hands-on experience with the challenges of mobile development.

On the web side, I focused on building an admin dashboard with React and Ant Design. This was where I built up my skills in React, implementing features like file uploads and data visualizations. I also redesigned the company's official website to improve user experience.

So, my time at Jinji was all about learning and building. It boosted my passion for web development and prepared me for the more complex challenges I took on later in my career.

### Backend Experience

> Could you tell me about your backend experience?

My main expertise is in frontend development, but I also have hands-on backend experience, especially with Spring Boot.

At Blitz Interactive Entertainment, I maintained the backend and developed new features for the company's instant messaging system using Spring Boot. This involved creating RESTful APIs and deploying it with Docker.

Most recently at Toyou Feiji Electronics, I worked with the backend team to refactor APIs. I used Python and Django to build Redfish-compliant APIs for our centralized storage management platform, and successfully refactored over 100 interfaces.

> Tell me about developing those Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs

The Redfish APIs were part of our storage management platform redesign. Redfish is a standard REST API specification for managing data center hardware - it's widely used in enterprise storage systems.

I refactored over 100 APIs to follow the Redfish standard. This involved standardizing URL patterns, data models, and error handling to match Redfish specifications. The main challenge was mapping our existing storage data to standardized schemas while maintaining backward compatibility.

> How does backend experience help you as a frontend developer?

Backend experience helps me understand APIs deeply, communicate better with backend teams, and debug issues faster. I can design better error handling. This full-stack perspective helps me build interfaces that work smoothly with backend systems.

### Vite Migration / Challenge

> Can you share a particularly challenging technical problem you encountered in one of your projects?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our distributed storage management platform had a critical performance issue. Our project was based on Vue 2, as the codebase grew, the Webpack build process was taking over 10 minutes, which was severely impacting our team's productivity.

My task was to find a solution that would improve build performance without disrupting our existing codebase or introducing bugs.

I researched various approaches and determined migrating from Webpack to Vite. However, this was complex because this project was based on Vue 2, and Vite primarily supports Vue 3. I had to carefully plan the migration, configure compatibility plugins, update our build configuration, and coordinate with our testing team to ensure stability.

As a result, we reduced build times from 10 minutes to under 4 minutes, over 60% faster then before. More importantly, this taught me the value of planning when upgrading core infrastructure and the importance of close collaboration with testing team.

> You mentioned improving build times by 60% - how did you achieve that?

I migrated our build system from Webpack to Vite. Webpack was slow because it bundled everything, even during development. Vite uses native ES modules and only processes changed files. This significantly reduced build times and improved team productivity.

### Architecture Redesign

> Could you walk me through the key decisions you made during that process?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our centralized storage management platform had no clear separation between frontend and backend, making it difficult to scale and maintain.

As a senior frontend developer, my task was to lead the redesign and implementation of a new, completely decoupled frontend architecture.

My first key decision was selecting Vue.js with TypeScript. I chose Vue.js and TypeScript for performance and type-safety, implementing a modular, component-based structure to enhance maintainability.

I established a standard code review process that ensured code quality.

As a result, I created a scalable, type-safe system that improved team productivity, enabling independent frontend and backend development for faster iterations.

 > What were the main challenges, and how did you ensure the new architecture was scalable and maintainable?

The main challenge was we couldn't risk a complete system replacement all at once.

My solution was a phased migration using a Nginx proxy. We used a proxy to direct traffic for specific routes to the new Vue application, while legacy pages were still served by the old system. This minimized risk and allowed us to iterate based on user feedback.

### Vue vs React

> How would you decide which framework, Vue or React, to use? What are the key technical trade-offs you would consider?

The choice between React and Vue.js really depends on several factors. From a technical standpoint, React offers more flexibility and has a larger ecosystem, but Vue provides a gentler learning curve and clearer structure out of the box.

React's component architecture offers more control, but Vue's template syntax can speed up development. React has better TypeScript support, while Vue offers simpler state management.

Overall, if the existing codebase or team expertise heavily favors React, that would be the practical choice.

> What are the key differences between Vue and React?

Both Vue and React are popular frontend frameworks, but they have different design concepts.

Vue provides a more opinionated structure with templates and built-in features like reactivity and directives, which makes it easier to start quickly. React is more flexible and component-driven, relying on JSX and external libraries for things like state management or routing.

In short, Vue feels more integrated, while React gives more freedom and ecosystem choices.

> This role focuses on React, but your recent experience is with Vue.js - how quickly can you transition?

I actually use React regularly in personal projects, my blog is built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, which matches your tech stack exactly. The concepts between Vue and React are very similar. Having experience with both frameworks actually gives me a broader perspective on frontend development.

### Communication

> How did you handle communication challenges?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, when I redesigned our centralized storage platform. As a senior frontend developer, I also worked with backend teams to refactor Redfish-compliant RESTful APIs.

We need to ensure the new APIs does not affect the original functionality and is type-safe. The main communication challenge was confirming the type definitions and possible values for each new API with the backend team.

We established a communication approach, we scheduled daily technical meetings to track complex issues and ensure clear communication.

We set up a shared documentation and a Postman collection so we could test endpoints together in real-time.

As a result, we successfully refactored all APIs, I also refactored over 100 interfaces.

This experience taught me that clear documentation is a great tool for communication.

### Job Scope / Documentation

> Can you describe a time when you had to take initiative on a project or problem that wasn't clearly defined in your job scope?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, I redesigned our centralized storage platform and collaborated with the backend team to standardize new APIs.

A key challenge was that no one had a clearly understanding about Redfish compliance. So I researched the Redfish standards, created documentation to guide the team, mapped old APIs to requirements. This wasn't in my job scope, but I saw it as essential for project success.

As a result, the APIs refactoring was successful, I also refactored over 100 interfaces. It was a excellent full-stack learning experience.

So, I'm comfortable taking on tasks beyond my job scope. And I think dive into different job scope can be beneficial for personal growth as you can learn new skills and knowledge.

### Learning Knowledge

> How do you stay current with rapidly evolving web technologies?

I keep up with web technologies by various approaches: I follow tech blogs like JavaScript Weekly and some personal blogs. Additionally, I actively contribute to open-source projects which keeps me hands-on with new technologies, and my GitHub projects force me to stay updated with community trends.

For domain-specific knowledge, I'd start with the company's documentation and industry standards, then actively learn from colleagues and hands-on project work.

### Data Visualization

> Can you walk me through a specific project where you implemented a data visualization dashboard?

I've developed data visualization dashboards in two key projects, both using ECharts.js.

At Blitz Interactive, I built an admin dashboard for our instant messaging system that handled real-time business inquiries. I used ECharts.js to display live users, inquiry types, and customer satisfaction scores.

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, I created a more complex storage device monitoring dashboard. We needed to track numerous hardware and software metrics across multiple storage clusters, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network. I used ECharts.js line charts to display real-time status indicators.

A major challenge was managing hundreds of metrics for data disks that updated every few seconds. I solved this by implementing data aggregation on the frontend, showing detailed metrics for selected devices while displaying summarized views for the cluster overview.

Both projects taught me the importance of balancing information density in data visualization.

### CI/CD

> Can you describe a project where you implemented or contributed to a CI/CD pipeline for a front-end application? Please

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, on our storage management platform, we used Git for version control, with feature branches undergoing ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks via pre-commit hooks. I configured Jenkins to automate builds for our frontend, creating binary files.

Since our storage devices were in a secure, offline environment, which limited full CI/CD automation. deployment had to be performed manually by the hardware team.

### XSS/CSRF

> Can you share an experience where you addressed a cross-browser compatibility issue or a front-end security vulnerability (e.g., XSS, CSRF)?

At Blitz Interactive, I secured our instant messaging system against XSS attacks, as user inputs like chat messages posed risks of malicious scripts.

During code reviews, I identified unescaped inputs in the frontend. I used the third library to filter inputs, preserving safe HTML for rich media, and ensuring secure user interactions.

 I tested compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. This strengthened my skills in frontend security.

### Mentore Junior

> Describe your management style when mentoring junior developers?

At Toyou Feiji, I mentored three junior developers using a structured approach. First, I got to know each person's learning style and career goals, then created personalized development plans.

I assigned a different range of development tasks, starting with simple ones and gradually increasing complexity until they were able to undertake all development tasks.

The key challenge was building their confidence while maintaining code quality, so I established a standardized code review process to ensure code quality.

### Deadlines / High-Pressure

> How would you handle tight deadlines with limited resources?

I actually handle pressure quite well. I focus on three things: what's most important, using what we have, and clear communication.

First, I work with the team to decide what features we must deliver and what can wait. When we had a tight deadline for a feature, I built the basic functions first, then added extra features later.

Second, I tell people about problems early, not at the last minute. If we need to change the plan, I explain the options clearly.

I'm happy to work extra hours when needed, but I try to keep code quality good so we don't create bigger problems later.

### AI

> How do you use AI tools in your development workflow?

I actively use AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini in my development workflow. They're excellent for research, documentation lookup, and helping with simple coding tasks, this significantly improves my development speed.

However, I see AI as a powerful assistant, not a replacement. Complex architecture decisions and full project development still require developer expertise.

At Toyou Feiji, I also worked on integrating AI into our workflow. We built an AI chat tool using RAGflow that helped our support team handle customer service issues. This tool automated responses to common questions and helped our support team focus on more complex cases.

> Can you tell me more about your role in AI chat tool?

At Toyou Feiji Electronics, our support team was overwhelmed with repetitive questions, so I led the development of an AI-powered chat tool.

My role involved designing and building the tool using Vue.js for the frontend and integrating it with Ragflow to power AI-driven responses. I focused on creating an intuitive interface with clear navigation and responsive design, optimized for both desktop and mobile users. This tool automated responses to common questions and helped our support team focus on more complex cases.

### Accomplishment / Interesting

> What's your biggest professional accomplishment?

My biggest accomplishment was leading the complete redesign of our storage management platform. As a result, I created a scalable, type-safe system that improved team productivity, enabling independent frontend and backend development for faster iterations.

> What's the most interesting project you've worked on?

The most interesting project was developing an AI chat tool integrated with Ragflow for customer support. It was my first deep dive into how AI can enhance user experience. The technical challenge of making AI responses feel natural and helpful was really engaging.

### Code Review

> How do you approach code reviews?

I see code reviews as both quality control and learning opportunities. As a reviewer, I focus on functionality, code standards, and sharing knowledge. When my code is reviewed, I'm open to feedback and try to make it easy to review with clear comments.

At my last job, I set up a code review process where we required at least one approval and ensure code quality, especially for junior developers.

### TypeScript

> How have you used TypeScript in your projects?

I've used TypeScript in my recent projects, especially for our centralized storage platform redesign. The main benefits are catching errors early and better code documentation.

I focus on strict typing from the start - defining interfaces for APIs, component props, and data models. As a result, our codebase became type-safe and easier to work with, when new team members join, they can understand the data structures just by looking at the types.

### State Management

> How do you handle state management in frontend applications?

I choose state management tools based on complexity.

For Vue, I use Composition API for simple state and Pinia for complex apps. For React, I start with useState/useContext and prefer Zustand for global state management. My principle is keeping state close to where it's used.

### Performance Optimization

> What specific techniques do you use for performance optimization?

I approach performance optimization on multiple levels.

For build-level optimization, like I did at my last job, I migrated from Webpack to Vite, which improved build times by 60%. I also implement code splitting and lazy loading for components.

For runtime optimization, I use techniques like memoization with React.memo or Vue's computed properties, using debounce or throttle function.

I use tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, or Web Vitals to identify performance issues.

## Development

## General Expression

- Sorry, could you please repeat the question?
- Thank you for your time today. I look forward to hearing from you.
- I haven't faced that exact situation, but I'm excited to learn.
